Urgent To-do:
- Add needed stuff to compile both from visual studio, visual studio code via Make or CMake using gcc / clang, etc...
- Add CLI Input stuff, maybe add a temporal class that has some very basic and rough functionality to test stuff while the real CLI is being worked on
- Finish ProcScanner.h
